Time complexity: O(log n)
Space complexity: O(n)

Algorithm:
- sort the array in the descending order using quick sort -> time complexity is O(n log n) and space complexity is O(1)
- iterate through the array and add every other element to string1 and string2 -> time complexity is 0(n) and space complexity is O(n)
- convert each string to an integer -> time complexity is 0(n)
